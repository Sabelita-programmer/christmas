I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents underneath the Christmas tree
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
make my dream come true
All I want for Christmas is you
Yeah

I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thiyng I need and I
don care about the presents underneat the Christmas tree
I don't need to than my stocking there upon the fireplace
Santa Claus won't make me happy with a toy on Christmas Day
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you
You, Baby __
